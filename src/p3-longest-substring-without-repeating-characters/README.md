[https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## First approach - Hashing + sliding window

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: $O(2n) = O(n)$
- space complexity: $O(min(m, n))$
