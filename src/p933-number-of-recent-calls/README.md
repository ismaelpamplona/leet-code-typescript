[https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/)

## Initial provided code
```Typescript
class RecentCounter {
    constructor() {

    }

    ping(t: number): number {

    }
}

/**
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new RecentCounter()
 * var param_1 = obj.ping(t)
 */
```

## First approach 

- time complexity: O(1)
- space complexity: O(1)
