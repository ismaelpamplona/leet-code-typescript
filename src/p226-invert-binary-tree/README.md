# p226-invert-binary-tree

[https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree)

## First approach - Recursive

My first approach was to use recursion 

- n = number of nodes
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(n)

## Second approach - Iterative

After seeing the official solution, I tried to implement the iterative solution.

- n = number of nodes
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(n)
