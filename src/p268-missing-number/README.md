## First approach - Hashing

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(n)

## Second approach - Bit manipulation (xor)

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(1)

## Third approach - Addition Approach

- n = number of elements
- time complexity: O(n)
- space complexity: O(1)
